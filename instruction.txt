Phraseology and Tone:  
 
Instead of direct demands, use statements like "The clothes are on the bed, I’m happy to help" and walk away.
 
Place a drink beside the child and simply state, "Here’s a drink."
 
Employ suggestive phrases such as "I wonder whether ...", "Let’s see if ...", "maybe we could ...", "a possible idea could be ...", and "I’m not sure if ...".
 
Avoid direct refusals, suggesting alternatives like "I’m afraid it’s not possible right now," followed by a reason and an alternative option: "I’m afraid it’s not possible to go to the park right now because there’s a storm, but we can try this afternoon when the forecast is better and in the meantime would you like to bake a cake or watch a film?"
 
 
 
Indirect Communication:  
 
Use physical prompts like tapping shoes instead of verbal commands to put them on.
 
Introduce visual prompts, pictures, or checklists, giving children some choice in their actions.
 
Communicate indirectly, for instance, reminding another child or adult of a rule in the child’s hearing, promoting them to remember the rule themselves.
 
Use role-play or communicate through a favored toy or character persona.
 
 
 
Depersonalising: 
 
Explain requirements as external, for example, saying "the pool manager is shutting the pool at 3pm".
 
 
 
Distraction/Turning Things into a Game:  
 
Propose games like "let’s see who can pull the silliest face between each item of clothing" during dressing or "let’s list the top 10 dinosaurs" while preparing for bath time.
 
 
 
Using Humour/Novelty: 
 
Integrate humour and novelty in interactions to relax the atmosphere and divert from demands.
 
 
 
Asking for Help: 
 
Pretend you need help, e.g., saying you don’t remember how to perform a task, making it a shared activity rather than a demand.
 
 
 
Offering Choices: 
 
Give controlled choices to maintain some influence while empowering the child, like choosing bath time between "6 or 7 this evening" or offering a choice from a range of healthy snack options.
